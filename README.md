This is a Chrome extension that allows you to quickly generate question/answer pairs via GPT-3 and add them to your Anki deck while browsing the web.

To use it:

1. Install and configure anki-connect plugin for your desktop Anki client (ankiweb does not provide API access so this is necessary to programmatically insert cards).
2. Obtain an OpenAI API Key if you do not already have one
3. Set the OpenAI key, anki-connect API key, and name of your anki deck in the options page of the Chrome extension

Happy prompt making!
